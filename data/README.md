# Data
* 2012-2016 census/ACS data: The [Demographics](http://austintexas.gov/department/demographics) division of the City of Austin's Planning and Zoning department compiled demographic data from the
 [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ces/data/restricted-use-data/demographic-data.html) and the
 [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs), and then uploaded this data in the form of [shapefiles on ArcGIS Online](https://arcg.is/011Wqi). 

* Transit GTFS data: The GTFS data is available on the City of Austin's [Open Data](https://data.austintexas.gov/) website (which links to the State of Texas Open Data portal).
 This data can be used for measuring the change in service after implementation of CapRemap. The Open Data portal provides GTFS data for the
 [Apr-Jun service period](https://data.texas.gov/Transportation/CapMetro-GTFS-January-2018-Apr-Jun-/fda5-ttfe) (pre-CapRemap) and for the
 [Jun-Aug service period](https://data.texas.gov/Transportation/CapMetro-GTFS-June-2018/yh9c-gmru) (CapRemap). For geographic analysis and visualization, the Open Data portal also provides shapefiles of the transit
 system [pre-CapRemap](https://data.texas.gov/Transportation/CapMetro-Shapefiles-JANUARY-2018/bfrj-kj5n) and [post-CapRemap](https://data.texas.gov/Transportation/CapMetro-Shapefiles-JUNE-2018/rwce-6ann)
